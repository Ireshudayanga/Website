          <p>Nine Arch Bridge is iconic in Ella and famous worldwide for its beauty. The impressive bridge is 25 meters high and a mammoth 91 meters long!</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Located just outside Ella Town and on the same route as Little Adam’s Peak, you’ll find it hidden up in the dense green hills among low-lying clouds.</p>
          <p>Walk through the beautiful bamboo forest before reaching the postcard-worthy setting, spending time admiring the stone arches and waving at the people passing by on the historic blue train.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is one of the best places to visit in Sri Lanka! Tip: You can also get a drink in one of the hilltop cafes and wait here for the train to pass.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Little Adam’s Peak may be smaller than its bigger sibling Adam’s Peak, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less impressive. The stunning ridge is made up of three green peaks that tower above the valley below. Hike through incredible nature, passing through local villages, tea plantations, and long grass fields. Reaching the top is a feeling like no other; it’s a chance to take in the sensational, panoramic views and feel as if you’re on top of the world!</p>
            <p>From Ella Town to the foot of the mountain, it is around a 45-minute walk. From the base to the top, it takes approximately 15 minutes . After your beautiful hike, look out for 98 Acres Resort on your return journey. This is a lovely spot to enjoy a coffee or a locally made tea with a view.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Lipton’s Seat in Haputale is the perfect morning or afternoon trip from Ella. Jump on the train to Haputale and take a tuk-tuk to the stunning viewpoint above Lipton tea plantation. This is where Thomas Lipton (a famous tea producer) would sit and admire his beautiful tea fields. It’s also the site where he planted the first seeds of Sri Lanka‘s biggest export. It’s easy to see why he chose this spot when you look down on the endless green fields of tea, with neat rows of bushes and smiling, hard-working locals picking leaves.</p>
